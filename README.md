#Le degré 13 de la littérature

If the myths that surround the number 13 are still alive
in all western cultures and beyond, then it is because
such a thing as western culture is radically rooted
in these myths, which represent nothing less than the
foundation myths of western culture itself.

Hence it is a legitimate – not to say crucial – task of literary
research to scrutinize the role of the number 13 in western
literature. One could for example compare the thirteenth line
of the most spoken-of and most written-about texts, let's say the
top 100.

This is the result.

The editor would like to thank Daniel Shiffman for his inspiring
lessons and for the scrolling algorithm used on the website.
Thanks go also to Nick Montfort for his inspiring work at the
boundaries of code and literature.

This book is dedicated to the memory of Werner Hamacher.

The source text sources used in this comparative research are all
taken from Project Gutenberg, the 13th line of each text
appearing here as it is held in that digital repository.
